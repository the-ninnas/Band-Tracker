# Band-Tracker

Groupie-tacker aka Band-tracker is my first fronend project in collaboration with bootcamp memebers Olari Tsernobrovkin and Kender Tasa. Using a static api, the task was to display artists, their info card and 'upcoming' concerts.

My task was html and css design.

This project uses:

# html
# css
# golang
